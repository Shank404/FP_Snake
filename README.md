It's very simple in it's design and mechanics.

- Install elm in your package manager -> ` npm install -g elm `
- Start your IDE of choice and open the project.
- Run following command in the integrated terminal -> ` elm reactor `
- Now open your browser and navigate to -> ` http://localhost:8000/src/SnakeGame.elm `

Have fun :)!
